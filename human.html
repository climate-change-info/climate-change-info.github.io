        <p><b><em>To stand up and say that 100% of global warming is because of human activity, I think on its face, is just indefensible</em></b>
 - Rick Perry, the US energy secretary
<br><br>
Humanity has arguably caused almost 100% of global warming since 1950.  (Hausfather, 2017) As mentioned in <a href = "causes.html">Causes</a>, the greenhouse effect is how climate change occurs. Most of the greenhouse gases that appear during the process are man-made. A main reason for this can include the continually rising demand for energy such as electricity. This increased the combustion of fossil fuels and releasing greenhouse gases. In fact the industrial activities caused by humans have raised the levels of carbon dioxide from 280 parts per million to 414 parts per million in the last 150 years.
