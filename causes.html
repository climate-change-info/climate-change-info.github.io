        <p>Climate change has many causes varying from humans to natural causes.
            Some major causes of climate change include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The burning of fossil fuels</li>
            <li>Deforestation</li>
            <li>Agriculture</li>
            <li>The greenhouse effect</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is a short video that explains the greenhouse effect.</p>

        <p>The greenhouse effect is the process by which the Earth slowly heats up. There are five major gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect. These are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Water vapour: This is the most plentiful out of the greenhouse gases. As the Earthâ€™s atmosphere warms up, the amount of water vapour increases and so does the probability of precipitation. It acts as a feedback system.
            </li>
            <li>Carbon dioxide: Carbon dioxide is a minor part of the atmosphere. It is released into the atmosphere via natural procedures such as respiration and natural disasters. There is also human activity involved such as deforestation, livestock agriculture and the burning of fossil fuels. Humans have surged the atmospheric CO2 concentration by more than 45% since the Industrial Revolution commenced.
            </li>
            <li>Methane: A gas produced by both natural and human processes. Some of these processes include landfills, agriculture and rice cultivation. By examining the molecular makeup of methane, it is observed that it is a much more active greenhouse gas but there is a much lower concentration of methane in the atmosphere.
            </li>
            <li>Nitrous oxide: Nitrous oxide is a strong greenhouse gas which is mainly produced during soil cultivation, fossil fuel burning and biomass burning.
            </li>
            <li>Chlorofluorocarbons: These are synthetic compounds (man-made) that are released into the atmosphere because they enable the destruction of the ozone layer. They are also flagged as greenhouse gases.
            </li>
        </ul>
